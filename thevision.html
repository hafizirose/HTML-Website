<p>
<h2>VISION</h2>

<p>
Every human being in this world has their own vision and mission.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I want to live a happy life and make people in my surrounding happy too.
</p>
The most significant individuals in our lives would be our family.
If our family are unhappy, nothing will make us happy.
</p>

<p>
Following the completion of my diploma courses, I will pursue a bachelor's degree.
</p>

<p>
My family would be thrilled to see me graduate with a degree certificate in hand. 
</p>

<p>
The completion of a degree would make many aspects of my life simpler and more manageable. 
</p>

<p>
As a result, if I am successful in finishing my studies, I will get closer to realising my goal. 
</p>

<p>
My subsequent goal is to use the money I have saved up to take my family and parents on vacation. 
</p>

<p>
My parents' health is deteriorating. They will eventually stop working.
</p>

<p>
As a result, it is up to me to cater to their requirements and whims in order to ensure that they lead a life that is full of contentment and convenience.
</p>

<p>
When everyone in my family is happy, I am pleased as well.
